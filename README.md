# Rylee's Module 02 Challenge

## Description

This challenge required me to build my own code from scratch. I put together a simple portfolio that I can add to as I work my way through the bootcamp. It includes a title displaying my name, a navigation bar with functioning links, a paragraph aboout me, and the projects I've worked on so far as well as contact information. I also made sure to add a recent photo of myself to go along with the bio paragraph.
