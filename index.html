          <p>
            Rylee Jolley is a 24-year-old self taught artist who loves to play video games to wind down, and participated in just about every art and digital media class in high school that you can think of. She is from Syracuse, Utah and has worked at Nordstrom for over 4 years as a sales associate as well as a makeup artist and a visual merchandiser.
          </p>
          <p>
            She's currently attending a Coding Boot Camp at the University of Utah in hopes that she might be able to make use of her creative and artistic mindset to become a fullstack web developer.
